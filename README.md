# PRODIGY_SD_01
I recently wrote a Python script to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This can be useful for scientists, engineers, and anyone needing to quickly switch between different temperature scales.
Key Features:
Versatile: Converts temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.
User-Friendly: Simple input mechanism to specify temperature and unit.
Accurate: Utilizes precise formulas for temperature conversion.
Example Use Cases:
Scientific Research: Quickly convert temperature readings in different units.
Engineering: Ensure correct temperature unit conversions in design calculations.
Everyday Use: Easily switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on preference.
